# topology-degree
Demo and tutorial for the computation of the topology degree $\Gamma_d$ from *di Sarra et al., 2025* https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012776.
topology_degree.ipynb is a demo and tutorial Colab notebook.

### 🔧 Usage
To compute the topology degree, run https://github.com/gdisarra/topology-degree/blob/main/topology_degree.ipynb 

The code in this repository is designed to be used both on:

* **Synthetic data**, generated within the included scripts.

* **User-provided data**, which can be integrated by following the format and examples provided in the notebook.

⚠️ **Note:** This repository contains ongoing work related to the analysis of topological structures in neural data. The current state of the code is not final and may undergo significant changes. Please use it at your own discretion.
